# Full Cycle Docker module - Node challenge

This project is a result of my dedication on Full Cycle course. Here you will found a project that uses Docker container to server a node application and uses another container with Nginx to access the node container through proxy reverse. Let's see how you can see the project running in your awesome machine.

## Requirements
Always is good to remember everything you will need before we begin:

- Node
- Docker desktop or Docker engine
- One Laptop or desktop (Just to making sure that you have one haha)

## Installation

```bash

```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
